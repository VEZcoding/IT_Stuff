Hello,

Welcome to my IT repository, where I will show my projects in making your
computer work more efficient. If you have any questions in available at vivian.erklavec@gmail.com.

1. Project is a simple python program that helps with organizing pdf documents. I did that when I started applying for jobs and wanted everything to be in order.
GUI is done with tkinter, which needs a program wkhtmltopdf (url --> https://wkhtmltopdf.org/). Programm also needs packages: pdfkit, PyPDF2, xlwings and tkinter. I created this simple program when I applied for jobs. It downloads a website of the job listing and merges it with your CV and cover letter, to created a ncie merged pdf file of your application. In addition it writes an excel file of your applied positions.
